Online Automated Machine Learning (OAML) function is designed to automate online pipeline design.
Search space includes River preprocessors, classifiers and ensembles.
Pipelines can be one of more steps depending on the data characteristics.

We provide 3 versions of OAML as basic, ensemble and modelstore. Each version reads data from an arff file
and requires certain parameters. Explanation of algorithms can be found in the following paper.
Please cite this paper if you publish your results.

OAML Requirements (extra to original GAMA requirements)
- pip install river==0.8.0 (Newer versions are creating errors at the moment, WIP.)
- pip install wandb (if live-plot function is used)
- pip install scikit-multiflow

If you use our applications, following are the user parameters and possible values. All 3 versions of OAML use the same
user parameters.
Alternatively, you can use GAMA with "online_learning=True" with your own script.

Example run:
    python OAML_basic.py 'data_streams/electricity-normalized.arff' 5000 5000 acc acc 60 evol False

#1 Data stream (str)
- Location of the stream you want to use for online learning. You can find example streams under "data_streams" folder.
- Must be arff file.

#2 Initial batch size (int)
- Number of data samples to be used for initial pipeline search.

#3 Sliding window size (int)
- Number of data samples to be used for pipeline update search at drift points.

#4 GAMA metric (str)
- Performance metric to optimize in GAMA pipeline search
- Should be one of the following:
     [acc, b_acc, f1, roc_auc, rmse]

#5 River metric (str)
- Performance metric to evalue in Online learning.
- Should be one of the following:
    [acc, b_acc, f1, roc_auc, rmse]

#6 Time budget (int)
- Time budget given to GAMA pipeline search.

#7 Search algorithm (str)
- Search algorithm to be used in GAMA pipeline search.
- Should be one of the following:
    [random, evol, s_halving]

#8 Live-plot (Boolean)
- Whether to create a live plot with Wandb-ai or not.
- Requires registration to https://wandb.ai/site
- If True, then remember to change entity and project names in the script.
You can then follow your runs through Wand-ai under those pages.
- Should be one of the following:
    [True, False]
